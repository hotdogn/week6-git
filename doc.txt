This is my first document based on my new terraform code and I am exiceted to say that it is 
going very well. So well in fact I've been so successful in building my Terraform code and exucuting it 
that i am write this document to perseve the steps and details of my souce resoucre and the specifc details 
of my code so it will be avaiable for future refrence and if i forget how to do the Terraform code.

resource "aws_lightsail_instance" "server1" {
name = "dev-server"
blueprint_id = "ubuntu_18_04"
bundle_id = "medium_1_0"
availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
user_data = <<-EOF
 #!/bin/bash
              sudo apt-get update
              sudo apt-get install -y apache2
              sudo systemctl start apache2
              sudo systemctl enable apache2
              echo '<h1>This is deployed by Barack </h1>' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF
  
} 

That should be in the Main.tf file and this :
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
        source = "hasicorp/aws"
        version = "4.61.0"

    }
  }
}
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  
}
should be in version.tf and now all you have todo is follow the terraform steps.
